abstract: Estimating human poses from a video is at the foundation of many visual intelligent systems. Various convolutional neural networks have been proposed, achieving state‐of‐the‐art performance on different image datasets. However, most existing approaches are image based, which deliver unreliable estimations on videos since they fail to model temporal consistency across video frames. Recently, another line of work leverages temporal cues for multi‐frame person pose estimation, yet still in an instance‐unaware fashion, disregarding the specific traits of different instances (persons) or different joints.
